<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.


2. Open Amazon.html in any web browser.


3. Explore the layout and features.



<h4>Folder Setup</h4>

If you're replicating this:

Keep all product and banner images inside an assets/ or images/ folder.

Link your styleAmazon.css properly in your <head> tag like this:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styleAmazon.css" />


<h4>Limitations</h4>

This is a static clone: no actual login, cart functionality, or dynamic data.

No backend integration or interactivity (e.g., dropdown effects are non-functional).


<h4>Future Improvements</h4>

Add JavaScript to improve interactivity

Make it fully responsive for all screen sizes

Include product sliders or carousels
