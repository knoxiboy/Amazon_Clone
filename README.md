## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `Amazon.html` in your preferred web browser
3. Explore the layout and features

## Folder Setup

- Keep all product and banner images inside the `pics/` folder
- Link your `styleAmazon.css` properly in your `<head>` tag:

```

## Limitations

- This is a static clone: no actual login, cart functionality, or dynamic data
- No backend integration or interactivity (e.g., dropdown effects are non-functional)
- Some elements might not be fully responsive on all screen sizes

## Future Improvements
